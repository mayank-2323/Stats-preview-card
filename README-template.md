## My process
So I relied on a mobile first approach.
I tried to make the layout as responsive as possible and use REM and EM tags as well as % instead of fixed values.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I believe that making the website completely responsive was a task - and that I need to learn it better.
One very interesting element I learnt was the background style in CSS - where I could add an overlay as well using linear gradient attribute.
